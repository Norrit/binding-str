# binding-str

`binding-str` allows you to specify binding variables directly inside
a string. During the evaluation of the `binding-str` macro the
variables get replaced with the actual content. If the binding can
not be found a compile error will be thrown.
  
The format of the binding specification is currently based on the
quoting syntax of Clojure, here is a little example:
              
    de.herr-norbert.binding-str.core> (let [name "World"]
                                        (binding-str "Hello `(name)!"))
    "Hello World!"

For more examples have a look at the tests.
